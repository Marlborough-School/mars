# Nepotism: A Case Study of Two Getúlio Vargas Descendants

Power and privilege have been passed down within families since the dawn of civilization. This phenomenon - nepotism - is seen in royal families, hereditary aristocracies, and family fortunes that are sustained over many generations. Consequently, modern discourse has coined the phrase “nepo baby:” someone who is likely to achieve fame or success as a result of their family’s accomplishments rather than their own merit. My project seeks to examine the present-day perceptions of nepo babies in relation to the idea of inherited privilege by looking at my own family: the Vargas’ of Brazil. My great-great-grandfather, Getulio Vargas (1882-1954), was the dictator and president of Brazil from 1934 to 1945 and 1951 to 1954. Getulio was a highly influential and controversial political figure in twentieth-century Latin America, and although his son Lutero had noted successes and controversies of his own, he never achieved anything comparable to his father’s accomplishments. Lutero’s daughter and my grandmother, Candida, suffered through a difficult childhood as a result of her family’s role in Brazilian politics - outcast by her peers and resentful of her family history. 
My research reveals the complexity of nepotism: the characterization of nepo babies as spoiled, entitled, and undeserving is accurate in some cases; however, these stereotypes overlook the nuanced impacts public scrutiny and familial expectations have on the children of powerful and influential people.
