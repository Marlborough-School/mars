Concussion is a significant concern for many student athletes, and therefore, understanding the brain bases of concussion will guide the development of 1) coaching techniques to minimize the frequency of TBI in high school football players and 2) effective and reliable treatments that lessen the severity of subsequent symptoms. Through the use of arterial spin labeling (ASL) and analysis of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) as a marker for brain metabolism, this longitudinal, prospective case-control study aims to understand the neurodevelopmental consequences of concussions and repeated head impacts in high school athletes (McAlister et al., 2023). Data were drawn from an ongoing longitudinal study of brain development and mental health outcomes in adolescent football players that began in 2017 (McAlister et al., 2023). Head impact data were recorded using the Riddell Head Impact Telemetry System (HITS; Simbex, Lebanon, NH). Arterial spin labeling (ASL) was performed at each participant's baseline and subsequent follow-up visits to measure brain metabolism. Although the change in rCBF from baseline to year 1 did not differ significantly in football players relative to controls in the cortex, football players showed a more substantial decrease in rCBF in the subcortical regions of the brain. Cumulative head impacts over the 1 year follow up period were inversely correlated with rCBF, primarily in the thalamus, striatum, and other subcortical regions. Finally, players who experienced concussion, relative to those who did not, (5 with, 7 without) had higher rCBF in cortical gray matter. Football players showed not only a decline in cortical blood flow, but also in subcortical blood flow, which were significantly correlated with cumulative head impacts. Football players with concussion (n = 5) relative to those without concussion showed increased rCBF to cortical regions of the brain, suggesting that blood perfusion was elevated possibly due to neuroinflammation, or due to disrupted or delayed normative brain development as a result of concussion.
