[Lily Title]() | *Issue 2 (2024-25)*

The extensive and diverse collection of restorative justice (RJ) research currently published shows the practice’s benefit to community-building and its ability to mitigate harmful consequences of the traditional criminal legal system; thus, RJ has been considered an upstream intervention method to the penal system. Researchers have analyzed state-level RJ legislation and have come to conclusions about failures, successes, and future steps for moving the restorative justice initiative forward. Focusing on California RJ legislation in youth educational spaces, my guiding research question was: Is California legislation aimed at increasing the usage and availability of restorative justice in schools accurately implemented and upheld? Using publicly available data and the Neighborhood Atlas’ Area Deprivation Index This paper’s analysis of RJ’s implementation in California schools seeks to understand 1) if RJ was implemented in the way it was outlined in related legislation and 2) where it was shown to be implemented (what area deprivation index the neighborhood of the school falls under.) Ultimately, the goal of this paper is to survey the landscape of RJ practices in schools across different socioeconomic levels and detect if specific legislation has improved RJ usage.
