:class: abstract

Glucagon, a peptide hormone naturally found in human and animal pancreatic α (alpha) cells, plays an integral role in the stabilization of blood glucose levels, given its ability to raise glucose levels (Joshi et al., 2000; Müller et al., 2017). Named for its role as a “glucose agonist”, the hyperglycemic properties that glucagon holds have made it an important aspect of diabetes management. However, glucagon’s insolubility in neutral solutions and tendency to aggregate or degrade in acidic and alkaline (non-neutral pH) solutions limits its utility to applications such as immediate emergency intervention in cases of severe hypoglycemia (Caputo et al., 2013; Müller et al., 2017). For glucagon to be useful for a wider range of biomedical applications, including for more routine treatment of moderate hyperglycemia in diabetes patients, its stability and solubility in aqueous environments must be improved. This study focuses on stability, examining several classes of excipients (inactive ingredients meant to stabilize formulations) to analyze their efficacy and potential in stabilizing glucagon in slightly acidic solutions (pH ~6.12), and also examining the extent of the effects of oxidative degradation (where reaction with oxygen causes losses of bioactivity) on glucagon’s stability. Chosen excipients from different classes of molecules (carbohydrates and amino acids, among others) were each dissolved in buffer solution, added to an aqueous hydrochloric acid (HCl)-glucagon solution, and examined at several time points via high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and liquid chromatography with mass spectroscopy (LCMS) to determine their stabilization capabilities and the extent of glucagon’s degradation in their presence, and thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence assays to determine the extent of aggregation. The most effective excipients were then reexamined with HPLC and ThT assays in triplicate to confirm their stabilizing capabilities. Glucagon was also examined in the presence of oxygen versus in the presence of argon (an inert gas) only, utilizing HPLC and ThT assays at several time points in a similar manner to the glucagon-excipient experiments. This study is in the process of obtaining and evaluating results.
