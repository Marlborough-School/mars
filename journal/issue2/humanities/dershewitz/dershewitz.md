Increased political polarization in the United States is often attributed to the rise of ideologically uniform communities on social media platforms. These polarized communities are often modeled as “echo chambers,” which are defined as insular groups of users who only receive information from one side of the political spectrum. Leading scholars suggest increasing the amount of cross-partisan information that users receive to “pop the bubble” and depolarize these spaces. However, an examination of the research on online echo chambers reveals that even this solution does not always result in depolarization. This study seeks to challenge the assumption that polarized communities behave according to the echo chamber model by surveying partisans on their consumption of political information on social media. This study found that the majority of polarized individuals are likely not in entirely insular communities and do receive some information from both sides of the political spectrum. Furthermore, it seems that the diffusion of cross-partisan information does not produce changes in political views or the polarization level among partisans. Despite this data, many partisans believed other individuals were in echo chambers, displaying a perception gap between the actual and perceived amount of people in echo chambers and implying high levels of affective polarization. Finally, the model this paper advances seeks to advise future research on solutions to polarized communities
