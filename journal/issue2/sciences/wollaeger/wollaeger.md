:class: abstract

A newly developed scientific field, epigenetics, works to provide a combined social and biological outlook on how toxic stress experienced in childhood relates to health challenges in adulthood. While studies are still working to solidify the fact that children in the foster care system experience epigenetic mutations due to high amounts of toxic stress, it is a confirmed fact that toxic stress leads to maladaptive mutations that increase the likelihood of various health risks such as cardiovascular problems and mental health disorders (Johnson et al., 2013). Brain plasticity is highest in childhood, so both negative and positive influences are highly defining of later life outcomes, thus making this an important developmental period. This paper works to identify how children in the foster care system, more so than children in the general population, face adult health challenges due to epigenetic mutations caused by the toxic stress factors that they are exposed to during childhood. Throughout this literature review, an exploratory analysis will be explained using a theoretical model and pre-existing research to support that hypothesis.
