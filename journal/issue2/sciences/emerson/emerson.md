Humanity's quest for improved energy storage solutions has led to significant strides in battery technology, particularly in the realm of lithium metal batteries (LMBs). LMBs benefit many technologies due to their high energy density, high capacity ( the total amount of electricity generated due to electrochemical reactions in the battery), and rechargeability. However, their usage is limited by major safety issues: flammability, short lifespans, and high risk of short-circuiting. One notable innovation to solve the issues of LMBs is the integration of solid electrolytes, primarily using the sol-gel method, which offers enhanced safety by limiting the likelihood of malfunctions. However, such methods gain this safety at the expense of performance, significantly limiting the batteryâ€™s usability. This study introduces a novel method for fabricating pseudo-solid electrolytes (ionogels) to bridge the gap between safety and performance. These ionogels combine the advantages of both solid and liquid electrolytes, offering significant improvements in longevity, cycling stability, and safety when compared to conventional electrolytes. Utilizing scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) Surface Area Analysis, Pore Size/Volume Testing Technique, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), along with a simple comparison to the plating and stripping of liquid electrolyte batteries, this study elucidates the microstructure and solvent exchange completeness of ionogels, confirming their potential as a safer and more efficient alternative to conventional electrolytes. These results, while preliminary, suggest that broader application of such ionogels may be seen in the future.Future research will include testing the ionogel thickness, testing the electrolyte degradation, and evaluating the possibility of macropore presence in ionogels to revolutionize energy storage systems. These examinations will pave the way for safer and more durable batteries in diverse applications past what they are used in now.
